To run this code, please run the following commands in three different terminals:

python3 sender.py
python3 intermediate.py
python3 receiver.py

Then, type a message into sender.py and see if the message successfully reaches receiver.py. If
it's unsuccessful, the program wouldn't know until another message is sent to receiver.py. You
can see whether individual fragments of the message get to receiver.py in the log of
intermediate.py.
